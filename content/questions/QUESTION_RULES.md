# Question Length Rules

## Rule: Target under 20 words

Questions should be concise but can include brief context where it aids learning. Target under 20 words. Cut preambles, Wikipedia-style introductions, and excessive scene-setting — but a short clause of context is fine and encouraged.

**Bad:** "What famous cartoon cat, created in 1978 by Jim Davis and syndicated in over 2,500 newspapers worldwide, is known for loving lasagna?"
**Good:** "What cartoon cat loves lasagna and hates Mondays?"
**Good:** "Which cat breed, named after the Isle of Man, is born without a tail?"

## What to cut
- Wikipedia-style biographical preambles ("created in 1978 by X and known for Y...")
- Excessive scene-setting the player doesn't need
- "Which of the following..."
- "Famous for..."
- Redundant qualifiers

## What to keep
- The core question
- A short context clause if it genuinely helps (e.g. "named after the Isle of Man")
- Any detail actually necessary to identify the correct answer

## What NOT to do
- Don't over-trim — a short context clause is good and encouraged
- Don't strip context that makes the question more interesting or learnable
