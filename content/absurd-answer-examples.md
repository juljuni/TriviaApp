## Absurd Answer Formula

Premium techniques that work:
1. **Name overlap + pun** (Alexander Graham Bell → Alexander Graham Cracker, Leonardo da Vinci → Leonardo di Caprio, Pablo Picasso → Pablo Escobar)
2. **Extend/modify correct answer** (H₂O → H₂OMG, Mitochondria → Mightychondria)
3. **Plausible suffix** (-ium like Collarbonium, -ism like Meltyism)
4. **Shared lore/context** (Mike Tyson ear incident, croissant/crescent roll shapes)
5. **Abstract made literal** (ego as physical organ)
6. **Category confusion** (celebrity as painter, drug lord as artist)
7. **Format mimicry** (H₂OMG uses chemical notation, Collarbonium sounds medical)
8. **Universal truth disguised** (Emoji is actually universally used)

## Critical Rules

### FORMATTING RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

❌ NO brackets anywhere in answer text
   Bad: "Paris, Texas (wrong country)"
   Good: "Paris, Texas"

❌ NO hyphens in wordplay or name puns
   Bad: "Albert Ein-stein"
   Good: "Albert Twostein"
   Bad: "William Shakes-spear"
   Good: "William Shakesman"
   Bad: "Mighty-chondria"
   Good: "Mightychondria"

❌ NO explanations, parentheticals, or clarifications
   Bad: "32 (if you count wisdom teeth separately)"
   Good: "64"

The absurd answer must look EXACTLY like a normal answer in format. If the pun requires a hyphen or bracket to work, it's not a good pun. Find a different joke.

NEVER do these:
❌ Use brackets or explanations: "Paris, Texas (wrong country)"
❌ Obviously joke answers: "My dating life", "Your mom"
❌ Self-referential humor: "Still waiting for the answer"
❌ Lazy puns that don't sound plausible

ALWAYS do these:
✅ Make it sound like it COULD be legitimate for 1-2 seconds
✅ Use real names, places, things in wrong contexts
✅ Wordplay that maintains plausibility
✅ Reference shared cultural knowledge
✅ Keep the same format/structure as real answers

## NUMBER-BASED QUESTIONS

When a question asks for a number and no clever wordplay exists, use simple exaggeration:

**Strategy:**
- Double the correct answer (makes people uncertain)
- Go absurdly high (creates "wait, really?" moment)
- Go absurdly low (sounds wrong but pauses thought)
- Off by one (creates doubt)

**Examples:**

**Question:** How many legs does a spider have?
**Correct:** 8
**Absurd:** 100 (centipede-level exaggeration)

**Question:** How many continents are there?
**Correct:** 7
**Absurd:** 47 (way too many, sounds official)

**Question:** How many bones in adult human body?
**Correct:** 206
**Absurd:** 412 (exactly double, creates uncertainty)

**Question:** How many teeth does an adult have?
**Correct:** 32
**Absurd:** 64 (double, sounds almost plausible)

**Question:** How many countries border Germany?
**Correct:** 9
**Absurd:** 23 (absurdly high, sounds official)

**Question:** Colors in a rainbow?
**Correct:** 7
**Absurd:** 12 (too many, but specific enough to pause)

**What NOT to do:**
❌ "Too many" (not a number)
❌ "More than you think" (not a number)
❌ "32-bit" (unrelated reference)
❌ "207 after breakfast" (self-referential joke)

Just use a wrong number that makes people think "wait, is it actually that many?"
