## Absurd Answer Formula

Premium techniques that work:
1. **Name overlap + pun** (Alexander Graham Bell → Alexander Graham Cracker, Leonardo da Vinci → Leonardo di Caprio, Pablo Picasso → Pablo Escobar)
2. **Extend/modify correct answer** (H₂O → H₂OMG, Mitochondria → Mighty-chondria)
3. **Plausible suffix** (-ium like Collarbonium, -ism like Meltyism)
4. **Shared lore/context** (Mike Tyson ear incident, croissant/crescent roll shapes)
5. **Abstract made literal** (ego as physical organ)
6. **Category confusion** (celebrity as painter, drug lord as artist)
7. **Format mimicry** (H₂OMG uses chemical notation, Collarbonium sounds medical)
8. **Universal truth disguised** (Emoji is actually universally used)

## Critical Rules

NEVER do these:
❌ Use brackets or explanations: "Paris, Texas (wrong country)"
❌ Obviously joke answers: "My dating life", "Your mom"
❌ Self-referential humor: "Still waiting for the answer"
❌ Lazy puns that don't sound plausible

ALWAYS do these:
✅ Make it sound like it COULD be legitimate for 1-2 seconds
✅ Use real names, places, things in wrong contexts
✅ Wordplay that maintains plausibility
✅ Reference shared cultural knowledge
✅ Keep the same format/structure as real answers
